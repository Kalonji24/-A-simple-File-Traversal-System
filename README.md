# -A-simple-File-Traversal-System
This project is a step-wise implementation of a File Traversal System in Java.
The program recursively lists all files and subdirectories within a given directory, applies indentation for hierarchy visualization, and provides summary statistics of:
- Total number of files
- Total number of directories
- Total size (in bytes)
